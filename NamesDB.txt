Who made me the genius I am today The mathematician that others all quote Who's the professor that made me that way? \nThe greatest that ever got chalk on his coat One man deserves the credit One man deserves the blame And Nicolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky is his name Hi! Nicolai Ivanovich Lobach— \nI am never forget the day I first meet the great Lobachevsky In one word he told me secret of success in mathematics: \nPlagiarize Plagiarize Let no one else's work evade your eyes Remember why the good Lord made your eyes So don't shade your eyes But plagiarize, plagiarize, plagiarize\n Only be sure always to call it please 'research' And ever since I meet this man My life is not the same And Nicolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky is his name Hi! Nicolai Ivanovich Lobach—\n I am never forget the day I am given first original paper to write It was on analytic and algebraic topology of locally Euclidean parameterization of infinitely differentiable Riemannian manifold,\n Bozhe moi! This I know from nothing What I'm going to do I think of great Lobachevsky and get idea -\n ha-ha-a! I have a friend in Minsk Who has a friend in Pinsk Whose friend in Omsk Has friend in Tomsk With friend in Akmolinsk His friend in Alexandrovsk Has friend in Petropavlovsk Whose friend somehow is solving now The \nproblem in Dnepropetrovsk And when his work is done Ha-ha! - begins the fun From Dnepropetrovsk to Petropavlovsk By way of Iliysk and Novorossiysk To Alexandrovsk to Akmolinsk To Tomsk to Omsk to Pinsk to Minsk To me the news will run yes\n, to me the news will run! and then I write by morning, night and afternoon and pretty soon my name in Dnepropetrovsk is cursed When he finds out I publish first! And who made me a big success And brought me wealth and fame? Nicolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky is his name Hi! Nicolai Ivanovich Lobach—\n I am never forget the day My first book is published Every chapter I stole from somewhere else Index I copy from old Vladivostok telephone directory This book was sensational! Pravda - well, Pravda - Pravda said:\n (Russian double-talk) it stinks But Izvestia! Izvestia said: (Russian double-talk) It stinks Metro-Goldwyn-Moskva buys movie rights for six million rubles Changing title to The Eternal Triangle With Brigitte Bardot playing part of hypotenuse And who deserves the credit? \nAnd who deserves the blame? Nicolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky is his name Hi!

For what purpose it was made is still unknown, though some speculate it was created in an attempt to [REDACTED].\n Whatever the case may be, SCP-0486 poses little danger to humanity.\n SCP-0486 causes headaches and migraines to those observing its contents.\n These effects seem to last about as long as a normal headache or migraine and have no lasting effects.
